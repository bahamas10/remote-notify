Remote notify is a plugin for weechat that will send
an HTTP request to a specific host on a specific port
whenever your nick is mentioned.

When invoked on the shell it will act as the webserver
that can recieve the request and display a growl/notify-osd
alert.

Usage:
On the remote machine running weechat:
	Enable the plugin:
	/python load remote-notify.py
On the machine you are connecting from:
	Start the service.
	~$ ./remote-notify.py
	* This starts the web service listening on localhost
	Then, ssh to the host running weechat and forward the port
	~$ ssh -R 4235:localhost:4235 user@host
